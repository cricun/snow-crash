found plain password in /etc/passwd:
flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

password does't work, must be encrypted
tried lot of cyphers in dcode.fr, nothing works
John the ripper decrypted password:

john passwd
john --show passwd
flag01:abcdefg:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash
